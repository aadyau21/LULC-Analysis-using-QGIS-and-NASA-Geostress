– Spectral Reflectance Curve analysis using NASA GeoStress data for identifying different geological features
– Worked on different satellite data, including Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS, Hyperion to compare their efficiencies
– Employed False Color Composites (FCC) for Vegetation Analysis and Land Use Classification data
– Implemented automated pixel selection and RGB-to-Hex conversion for efficient land-use classification
– Developed a MATLAB script to automate the analysis of spectral reflectance data from .spectrum files
– Derived Kappa coefficients and determined the overall efficiency of around 97% based on ground truth data
– Software/libraries MATLAB, QGIS, Google Earth Engine, Planet Labs, VsCode, NASA Geostress
